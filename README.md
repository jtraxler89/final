Project Description: This project is meant to be a site where users can submit reviews of bars, specifically related to their
happy hour experience, across a variety of dimensions (drink specials, food specials, ambiance, and an overall rating). The user
can also leave written commentary on their experience. Rather than simply being a review of a bar, this should help the users
better understand happy hour offerings by day of the week. With the data collected, a future iteration of this idea can provide
rating distributions by day to help people decide what days are the best at what bars for happy hour. Please use responsibly 
and have the happiest of hours!

Motivations: Have you ever heard that a place has an awesome happy hour only to go and realize its only on a certain day of the week?
SAME! That was the motivation behind creating this site. Through others pain, suffering, and willingness to write reviews, this site
will help you make the most of your happy hour experience, making it the happiest hour of your day.

Future additions: data on bars spread by day; more sort and drill-down functionality of reviews and comments by day; add dates to
reviews for better information purposes and sorting (outdated reviews); sorting and searching by keywords, neighborhood, etc.;
better landing pages and validation when you add reviews not logged in; data validation to make sure users with the same email
can't be added; data valiadtion of form inputs (telephone, emails, etc.); data validationto make sure that the same bar cannot be
added twice (based on phone number); etc.
